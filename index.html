    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 16, 2026</p>

    <p>DayPlanner ("the App") is developed by Sean Brady. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles your information.</p>

    <h2>Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
    <p>DayPlanner is designed with privacy as a core principle. The App operates entirely on your device. We do not operate servers, collect personal data, or transmit your information to third parties.</p>

    <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>The App stores the following data locally on your device to provide its functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Itineraries</strong> — Day plans you create, including place names, addresses, times, and notes. Stored using Apple's SwiftData framework on your device only.</li>
        <li><strong>Conversation History</strong> — Your chat history with the AI assistant is saved locally so it persists between sessions. You can clear it at any time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is never uploaded to any server and remains under your control. Deleting the App removes all stored data.</p>

    <h2>Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App may request access to the following device capabilities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location</strong> — Used to find places near you when searching for restaurants, parks, and other points of interest. Your location is sent to Apple Maps to perform searches and is subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>. We never receive or store your location data on any server.</li>
        <li><strong>Calendar</strong> — Used to view your existing events for conflict checking and to export itinerary stops as calendar events. Calendar data is accessed locally on your device and is never transmitted externally.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both permissions are optional. The App will ask before accessing these features, and you can revoke access at any time in Settings.</p>

    <h2>AI Processing</h2>
    <p>The App uses Apple Intelligence (Apple's FoundationModels framework) to power the AI assistant. All AI processing occurs on your device. Your conversations are not sent to external servers or used to train AI models.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses the following Apple platform services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Apple Maps / MapKit</strong> — For place search and map display. Subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>EventKit</strong> — For calendar integration. Data stays on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Apple Intelligence</strong> — For on-device AI processing. Data stays on your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The App does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection Summary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect personal information.</li>
        <li>We do not use analytics or tracking tools.</li>
        <li>We do not display advertisements.</li>
        <li>We do not share data with third parties.</li>
        <li>We do not require an account or login.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If this Privacy Policy is updated, the revised version will be posted on this page with an updated date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
